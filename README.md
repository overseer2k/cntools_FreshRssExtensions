# FreshRSS extensions

This repository contains a fork of cn-tools unofficial FreshRSS extensions.
The main reason for this for was a modification of the FilterTitle extension. The settings are now 'user' based, instead of 'system' wide. This allows each user to specify black and whitelists individually.

## Available extansions

### FilterTitle

This plug-in helps you to filter feed entries by keywords parsed by the feed entry title

## Translations

[![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/cntools-freshrssextensions/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/cntools-freshrssextensions)

You can help me to translate my extensions to a couple of languages on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/cntools-freshrssextensions). Or send me a new translation as pull request. I am happy to see!

## Installation

To install an extension, download the extension archive first and extract it on your PC.\
Then, upload the specific extension(s) you want on your server.

Extensions must be in the `./extensions` directory of your FreshRSS installation.
